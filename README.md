# Windows 10 IoT Core
This repo is all about my code for the Raspberry Pi 2 running Windows IoT core. At the moment, the code is only written in C# but in the future, I will rewrite the code with Python. As expected, I am using Visual Studio 2015 to compile the C# code and my code requires the RTM version of Visual Studio 2015 or higher to run. 
Most of the code written here is Hardware driven assited by the Rasbperry Pi 2's GPIO headers
